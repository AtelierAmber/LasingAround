[technology-description]
helium-extraction=Oil and natural gas reservoirs often contain helium released by the radioactive decay of underground minerals. Improved filtration and distillation methods allow the helium to be captured and used.
laser=Basic principles of laser design.
helium-laser=A low power laser, useful for sensors and communication networks.
carbon-dioxide-laser=A high power laser that can be used as a welder or a weapon.

scanner=High throughput electronic identification system
spectroscopy=Identify and isolate substances based on their optical properties.
tracking-systems=An essential component of every smart fridge.

laser-mill=High-tech machine that uses lasers to cut and weld. Conserves materials due to extreme precision, but requires helium to maintain an inert atmosphere.
micron-tolerance-manufacturing=Cut tiny mechanical parts from invar for precision applications.
micron-tolerance-instruments=Micron-tolerance invar components are ideal for creating sensitive measurement equipment that remains accurate under all conditions.

spectroscopic-helium-extraction=Diagnostic spectroscopy helps to increase the efficiency of petrochemical processing.

micron-tolerance-space-machines=Studying the rigors of extranauvian operations allows spaceborne mechanisms to be redesigned.
polariton-laser=These are real, but I'm too stupid to understand the wiki page.
advanced-rocket-navigation=Using advances in communications, quantum computing, and stellar mapping to more efficiently compute rocket trajectories.

lasingaround-k2-advanced-assembler-can-laser-mill=Allow K2 advanced assembler to perform laser mill recipes

[mod-setting-description]
lasingaround-allow-gubbins-in-mill=There are relatively few recipes in vanilla that strictly fit with the laser mill's flavor-function. This setting loosens the restriction and allows the laser mill to craft simple intermediates like copper wire.
lasingaround-allow-entities-in-mill=The laser mill can always create basic pipes (and steel pipes with Krastorio) regardless of this setting.
lasingaround-hide-duplicate-recipes=Laser mill recipe variants are identical to their assembler versions, save the need for helium. This setting hides these recipes from the handcrafting menu to reduce clutter. This does not hide recipes which can only be made in the laser mill. Recipes that have a laser mill variant will have an addendum to their description indicating this.
lasingaround-k2-advanced-assembler-can-laser-mill=This only applies to laser mill exclusive recipes like low density structures. The advanced assembler can never craft the exchange-helium-for-productivity versions of normal crafting recipes (the bonus productivity is attached to the laser mill entity itself, so the advanced assembler would be consuming helium for no benefit.)
